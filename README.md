## Why is Bolt faster and how much?

Because it does not scan each directory and file but skips as many of them as possible. Once you use the Page-Object in your code Kirby will lazily load uninitalized properties.

How much is gained depends on how many have been skipped. You can in average expect it to be n-times faster by the average folder count in your content tree. Example: 1000 pages in 10 folders 3 levels deep: 10\*10\*10. If you need a page from the third level Kirby would have to create a page index of 10+10+10=30 pages but Bolt will create only 3.

## Usage
```php
// lets assume 1000 pages: 10*10*10
$id = 'this-page-has/ten-siblings/in-every-subfolder';
$page = page($id); // kirby core
$page = bolt($id); // ~10x faster lookup

// can lookup beginning at a certain page as well
$page = $somePage->bolt($idInTree);

// it's even faster when you look up based on a directory name
$page = bolt('1_this-page-has/5_ten-siblings/3_in-every-subfolder');
```

## Works great with

- [kirby3-autoid](https://github.com/bnomei/kirby3-autoid) where it speeds up the page lookup
